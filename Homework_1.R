# 1. Build a histogram with some simulated data (i.e., data you have used R to generate for
# you) to illustrate a normal distribution. Run a normality test to confirm this and report the
# associated statistics. Justify your choice of normality test. (6)


gen_r_data <- rnorm(n = 100, mean = 15, sd = 0.5)
shapiro.test(gen_r_data)

# Shapiro-Wilk normality test
# data:  gen_r_data
# W = 0.98894, p-value = 0.5799
# This is a normal distribution as the p-value > 0.5.


hist(
  gen_r_data,
  xlab = "Generated Data",
  main = "Generated R Data Histogram",
  sub = "MAR 504 Part B",
  col = "blue"

# 2. Plot the corresponding probability density function and cumulative distribution function.
# (4)

dens_gen_data <- density(gen_r_data)

xlab = "Generated Data",
main = "Generated R Data Probability Density",

#
# 3. Make a box and whisker plot of your data that clearly highlights the mean, median,
# interquartile range, and outliers (if any). (4)

# 4. Define a binomial and poisson distribution (2). Describe the major differences and
# provide an example of an associated data type for each (4).


# 5. From the data table below, manually calculate the mean, average deviation, sum of
# squares, degrees of freedom, sample variance, standard deviation, and standard error.
# Clearly show your work for each step. (7)
